# Slides template

This a template for [Backslide](https://github.com/sinedied/backslide).
Basically, a bunch of modified Sass from the starter theme Backslide comes with.

Check out a [demo](http://coopdevs.org/assemblea_katuma_30_05_2018/).

## Installation

Just clone this repo in your machine running

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:coopdevs/slides_template.git
```

## Usage

You need to provide the `--template` argument when initializing a new
presentation as follows:

```sh
$ bs init --template <path_to_this_template>
```

Note path_to_this_template must point to the `/template` folder. There is where
the template files Backslide expects to read live. 

Check out [Backslide's docs](https://github.com/sinedied/backslide#usage) for
more details.
